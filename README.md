1. Proposed methodology flow:

2. Dataset details:

We created our own dataset because there was no such dataset that could be used for our problem statement directly and their simulation gives us several inclined perspectives of the surfaces together with their orthogonal projections. Ground truth homography is also specified in this collection for several image perspectives. Our homography dataset contains more than 300 images from different perspectives with different combinations of transformations. We also collected some real-world images using a Nikon D7200 DSLR camera and mobile phones. The images in our homography dataset have different dimensions ranging from 512 x 512 to 2165 x 1506 (H x W, where H is height and W is the width of the image).
